# TODO

- when in landscape mode, the virtual keyboard pretty much encompasses the entire screen making it very difficult to see anything in things like combobox dropdowns.. may have to do something about landscape mode for those..
- fix all apple pencil issues
- add some kind of spell explorer where you can see a list of all spells and get to their descriptions
- if the user only has one character, just auto select it if none is selected
